Terrain generation for Basic, schorching and other planets in the Geoverse.

Basic planets: based on vanilla

Barren planets: Rocky, dull of life and hollow. There will be many types of skeletons and a special kind of villager. The only landscapes are: Barren mountains, Barren plains, and dry oceans. Dry oceans are the most important part of these planets, it is an ocean without water, so it is instead just a very large pit, the main dungeon will rarely be in one of these areas, and will be used to progress to the next planet type. A basic space suit must be equipped to enter and survive on this planet.

Scorching planets: Venus type. The only mobs here will be red-orange goblins (slaves to the dragons), miniboss dragons, boss dragons, tame dragons, and the abomination that is found in the main dungeon. The only landscapes are: Dragonfire peaks, scorched bog, and lava lakes. The Dragonfire peaks are the most important part of this planet, this is where most of the dragon types spawn and it is where the main dungeon lies, which will be used to progress to the next planet type. The scorched bog is also important as there are important resources there and many different types of randomly generated structures. An advanced space suit must be equipped to enter and survive on this planet.

Gas giants: The most terrifying planet type so far. An ambitious feat to develop, but also to beat in-game. Use a Scorching core (found from within the main dungeon at a scorching planet) and other resources to craft yourself a Hyperatmospheric Harness. The Hyperatmospheric Harness must be equipped alongside the advanced space suit to enter and survive on this planet type. Because there is no solid ground in a gas giant, you use the Hyperatmospheric Harness to fly around. There will be very unique mobs here, they do not have organs. They are simply amalgamations of intricately colored bone-like material in strange but symmetrical shapes. They can gain immunity to attacks and depending on the enemy type, they melee or have various ranged attacks (including laser beams and poisonous spines that shoot out from their backs). Only a few of these enemy types can float around in the atmosphere freely like you can when using the Hyperatmospheric Harness. There will occasionally be structures made out of the same, bone like material that the enemy faction there is made out of. These structures are where the player wants to go to progress. The rest of the enemy types will spawn here and there will be loot. It is not necessary to have the Hyperatmospheric Harness while inside these structures because they are made of solid blocks, however it is highly recommended because these structures have wide gaps and steep tunnel ways that can be quite hard to traverse. There will be one main structure on this planet type, it will look like an even bigger version of the other structures previously mentioned. There will be various puzzles to get through to the main boss and loot area, and the blocks that make up the structure cannot be broken. This is very challenging and takes top level gear, it is highly recommended to bring a team to try to take down a Gas giant (referring to the planet and its main dungeon)
